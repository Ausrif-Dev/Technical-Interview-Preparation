 * A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. A station is denoted by Si,j where
 * i is either 1 or 2 and indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates the number
 * of the station.
 * 
 * The time taken per station is denoted by ai,j. Each station is dedicated to some sort of work
 * like engine fitting, body fitting, painting, and so on. So, a car chassis must pass through
 * each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory.
 * 
 * The parallel stations of the two assembly lines perform the same task. After it passes through
 * station Si,j, it will continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides to transfer to the other line.
 * 
 * Continuing on the same line incurs no extra cost, but transferring from line i at station j â€“ 1
 * to station j on the other line takes time ti,j.
 * Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and exit time xi which may be different for the two lines.
 * 
 * Give an algorithm for computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.
